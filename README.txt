This demo is totally programmed in my spare time, which aims to learn how to develop a python library based on C code. By using Cython, one can combine the high efficiency of C and high interpretability of Python.

HOW TO USE the demo?
(1) find a Mac, especially with OS Yosemite
(2) use the terminal to enter the folder of demo
(3) python test.py


* the binary file (tv_flow_warp.so) is already compiled from C. I could not provide all the codes due to complexity. However, one can enter the folder “src” to check my written codes (In horn_schuck_warp_c.c, my contribution is mainly in the numerical part rather than the framework).
